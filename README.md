# HOUSE-Price_predictor
Our goal for this project is to build an end to end solution or application that is capable of 
predicting the house prices better than individuals. 
Here weâ€™ll discuss about the prediction of future housing prices that is generated by machine 
learning algorithm and For the selection of prediction methods we compare and explore various 
prediction methods. 
In this project, we have built a machine learning model to predict the house prices of a dummy city.This 
project will very helpful for the real estate market. Our model can be used by both house sellers and 
house buyers. Multiple Linear Regression algorithm is used to create model with a great accuracy score.
The goal of this project is to predict house prices in Dummy city based on some features such size/area, 
number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms . Dummy house price dataset is used to create the 
model. We are using Machine Learning Algorithm to create a predictive model . Multiple Linear 
Regression algorithm is used to train and test the model in our project
